# SteemCode
My very own programming language

# How to Use
Syntax:
command always begins with '!'
each argument gets its own line below command
every command has a different number of args
-----
Example:
!say
hello
-----
here, we are running the 'say' command with the argument 'hello' which will print out the word, hello
-----
Commands:
so far there are
!say
!read
!edit
!clear
!pause
-----
say prints a string, it only needs one argument line|
read prints text from a file and needs one argument line containing the name of the file|
edit changes the text in a file and needs 2 arguments, the first for the file being changed, the second for what to change it to|
clear clears everything that has been printed needing no arguments|
pause waits a given amount of time needing only one argument for the amount of time to pause|
